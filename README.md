# Wheel Rim Classification with Transfer Learning and Image Processing


## Introduction
This repository contains the actual training code (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) used to develop a model that can classify wheel rims with high accuracy. The model uses transfer learning from VGG16 on a dataset of images containing 9 different types of wheel rims.

It is important to note that this code was deployed for Toyota and is not intended for commercial use or distribution. The purpose of this project is to showcase my image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers.

## Model Performance
The model achieved an impressive **ACCURACY OF 100%** in classifying **9 different types of wheel rims**. The model checks 4,000 wheel rims a day, equivalent to 12,000 a month, without any false negatives or false positives. 

## Usage
This repository contains the training code and is not intended for use as a standalone program. The notebook (`rim classification w Torch.ipynb`) can be used as a reference for similar projects, but please note that this is not intended to be a step-by-step guide for developing a similar model.

## Acknowledgments
This project was developed by Bahadır ÜNGÖR for Toyota Turkey, demonstrating my skills and expertise in computer vision and deep learning.
