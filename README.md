# Wheel Rim Classification with Transfer Learning and Image Processing

## Introduction
This repository contains the actual training code (`Wheel Rim Classification.ipynb`) used to develop a model that can classify wheel rims with extraordinary accuracy. The model leverages the power of TensorFlow and Keras, alongside transfer learning from VGG16 and advanced image processing techniques, to achieve a remarkable **100% accuracy** on a dataset of images containing 16 different types of wheel rims.

It is important to note that this code was deployed for Toyota and is not intended for commercial use or distribution. The purpose of this project is to showcase my exceptional image processing, augmentation, and modeling skills to potential employers.

## Model Performance
The model achieved an astounding **100% accuracy** in classifying **16 different types of wheel rims**. This unparalleled accuracy was accomplished by utilizing cutting-edge image processing techniques to meticulously extract the wheel rims from the images, and employing transfer learning from VGG16, implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. The model processes a staggering 4,000 wheel rims every day, equivalent to 12,000 a month, without a single false negative or false positive. Such an extraordinary level of accuracy stands as a true testament to the unparalleled power of transfer learning and image processing in elevating the performance of computer vision models.

## Usage
This repository contains the training code and serves as a testament to the remarkable capabilities of TensorFlow, Keras, and advanced image processing techniques. The included notebook (`Wheel Rim Classification.ipynb`) can be used as a reference for similar projects, providing insights into the state-of-the-art methodologies employed. However, it is important to note that this repository is not intended as a step-by-step guide for developing a similar model.
